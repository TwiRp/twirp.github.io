## [Random Heuristics for Mail](http://rhm.twirp.in)

We believe [e-mail isn't broken](http://singularityhub.com/2015/08/17/why-email-is-broken-and-what-will-replace-it/).  The way we interact with e-mail is.  There's [paradigms](http://www.43folders.com/izero) for how to interact with your e-mail, and there's applications that help you do that, but it's all too much.
