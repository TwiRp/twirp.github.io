## [ultheme parser](https://github.com/TwiRp/ultheme-vala)

A way to convert [Ulysses Themes](https://styles.ulysses.app/themes) to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) focused [GtkSourceView Style Schemes](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView/StyleSchemes).

This is primarily used for [ThiefMD](https://thiefmd.com).

## [ThiefMD](https://thiefmd.com)

A Markdown editor built for making large documents (like Novels or dissertations). Break up your writing into manageable chunks, and use the Export tool to put it all together as Markdown, PDF, HTML, DocX, and more.

It's [built on open source](https://github.com/kmwallio/thiefmd#acknowledgments), so feel free to help us make it better.
